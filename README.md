# newsched â€“ the final frontier #

A messaging-based implementation of GNU Radio scheduling.

This is a clean-slate approach to write a GNU Radio runtime that works for humans.

Its goal hence is not compatibility with current GNU Radio; we'll merge it into GNU Radio and add existing block wrappers as soon as a MVP works.

There are several design documents in the process of being cleaned up right now; will be added here later on.
